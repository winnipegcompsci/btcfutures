BTC Futures: TODO List
------------------------------------------------------
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Obligation Vs Available Calculations:
    OKCoin: Done. Using the userinfo_4fix.do method.
    796: This will need to be done using multiple API calls. I am trying to nest these calls together:
        eg: get assets, then get all active orders, use balance from asset / orders info for each active position.
    BitVC: Uses getAssets() and futures/holdOrder
    BTCe: Uses OrderInfo and getInfo (user info).
    BitMEX: Uses /orders method (GET request)

BitMEX API:
    I am working on trying to get the POST API authorization to work with BitMEX.
    
    I created a test class using the test-cases BitMEX offers to try and create my HMAC(Sha256) hash that gets used to sign the request. 
    This test class passes, the hmac hash generated matches the expected result based on the input, however when trying to place an order I get the following error:
    
    Response from BitMEX:
        "error":{
            "message":"Signature not valid.",
            "name":"HTTPError"
        }
    
        Error: 401: BitMEX.executeRequest() 
        HTTP status code 401 returned from POST request to url https://testnet.bitmex.com:443/api/v1/order 
        with method order and params 
        {
            "symbol":"XBUZ15",
            "quantity":-1,
            "price":263.81,
            "type":"limit",
            "clOrdID":"BITMEX1440800207912"
        }
        
    I am in the midst of discussing this with the BitMEX CTO 'BitMEX_SAM',
    to try and debug this. He is in the process of creating an official NodeJS API Wrapper, 
    so as that is in the works I will be combining the official API with out custom wrapper.
