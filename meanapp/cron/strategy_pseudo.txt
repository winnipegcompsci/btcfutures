--------------------------

If exchange's current price goes up 1.25% above exchange's average buy price. Sell short on the exchange at insurance coverage rate * current amount insured on exchange. Once this insurance is sold it waits for the exchange's last price to get to a 2.5 gain over the exchange's average buy price, it then sells half the amount we are currently holding long on the exchange. If the exchange's last price is 4% greater than the average buy price on the exchange we buy short at (long amount  held * insurance coverage rate) / 2.

If the exchange's last price goes down after selling insurance it stops out at the exchange's average buy price + 1.25%.

If the exchange's last price goes down before we have sold short, once it is 1.25% below the average buy price on the exchange, we buy short at (exchange.currentlyHolding * insurance coverage rate).
